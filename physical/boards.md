# Overview

* The boards are wooden.
* There are 2 boards:
  * Map, for exploration.
  * Clanlands (Town and details, and surroundings), to mark the current state of the clan.
* Elements on the board are cut out, to show the high-water mark that's possible.
* The boards itself are of uniform depth 1.
* Each player also has a board, describing their clan member.

## Elements

* Elements can be placed into slots.
* Slots come in different shapes, so not all slots take all elements. This is a key feature.
* The cut out elements that can be plugged into the board are depth 2 so they can be gripped easily.
* Most elements have two sides, so their state can be toggled (if they are not symmetric, they will have to be glued together).

## Map structure

* Hexagonal pieces that fit each other.
* Only Kero Fin and the immediate surroundings of the clan are visible initially.

## Clanland structure

* Base: Dark wood.
* Center:
  * Runestone in a lighter wood so it grabs the eye.
  * Runestone has cutouts corresponding to the relevant runes so runes can be placed into them.
  * The runes themselves have a glowing and a dark side to mark whether the rune is active.
  * All slots are always filled. Initially, no rune "glows".
* Close to the center:
  * Slots for temples and crafts etc.
  * Slots for defensive measures.
* Further out:
  * Slots for Chicken/Sheep/Cows.
  * Slots for defensive measures.
* Edge:
  * Slots for guard towers.
