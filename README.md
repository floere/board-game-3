# board-game-3

* The key word "perhaps" acts as a TODO.

## Overview

* A board game set in Glorantha, a mixed (high/low) fantasy setting.
* Players determine the fate of their clan, leading it to greatness.
* Players are on the inner clan ring so they can decide on what their clan does.
* A game master (GM) describes and manages the environment.
* Players can perform Hero Quests (HQ), explore the map, perform cattle raids and defend against cattle raids.
* Players also will have to deal with unique situations that range from the mundane (a Thane asks for your daughter's hand) to the exotic (a dragonnewt priest comes up to a guard tower and asks to speak to the clan ring). Stories develop depending on how the players deal with them.
* Years go by as the players play.
* Each year is perhaps divided into six seasons:
  * Sea (Spring)
  * Fire (Summer)
  * Earth (Fall)
  * Dark (Winter)
  * Storm (Chaotic)
  * Sacred (Death/Rebirth, 14 days long)

## Setup

* The game is set up in the following order:
  * Clan
  * Clan Members
* Then the game starts in a season.

### Clan

* Players decide on a clan name.
* Players decide on a location of their clan, perhaps randomly - so the GM knows what enemies they have.
* Players decide on their clan's runes.
* Players perhaps decide how their clan came to end up in Dragon Pass.
* Players decide whether their ancestors had slaves.
* Players decide which god(s)/goddess(es) their ancestors worshipped.
* Players perhaps also decide whether they are a warrring or peaceful clan.

### Clan Members

* Players perhaps distribute points/masteries over 5 runes (and put them into the rune slots).
* Players decide how old they are - they may die of old age during the game.
* Players choose a portrait (and put it into the portrait slot).
* Players decide how they are related.
* Players decide whether they have a husband/wife yet, and whether they have kids, and how many (put these into their slots).
